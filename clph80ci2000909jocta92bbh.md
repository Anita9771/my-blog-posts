1. **Web5**: An advanced iteration of the web that integrates decentralized technologies to give users control over their data and identity.
    
2. **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: A new type of identifier that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject and independent of centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.
    
3. **Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)**: Server nodes in the decentralized web architecture that store and serve decentralized data. They are part of a network that ensures data availability and integrity without central control.
    
4. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: A digital movement that allows individuals to own, control, and present their identity data without relying on centralized authorities.
    
5. **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Digital statements that are made by an issuer about a subject, which can be verified anytime by anyone.
    
6. **Blockchain**: A distributed ledger technology that allows data to be stored globally on thousands of servers while letting anyone on the network see everyone else's entries in real-time.
    
7. **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers instead of a single computer.
    
8. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Organizations represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government.
    
9. **Public and Private Keys**: A cryptographic key pair that allows users to perform various digital interactions securely.
    
10. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network**: A decentralized communications model in which each party has the same capabilities and either party can initiate a communication session.
    
11. **Hashing**: The process of converting an input of any length into a fixed-size string of text, using a mathematical function.
    
12. **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)**: A digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time.
    
13. **Authorization**: The process in a DWN environment where access rights are granted to users or nodes to access resources or perform specific actions.
    
14. **Permissions**: The set of rules defining what actions users or nodes can perform within a DWN system, often linked to their identity or role.
    
15. **Protocols**: Sets of rules and standards used to enable communication between nodes in a DWN, ensuring consistent and secure data transmission.
    
16. **Data Model**: The structure and format of data stored and managed within DWNs, dictating how data is organized, accessed, and manipulated.
    
17. **Messaging**: The method of communication between nodes in a DWN, including the transmission of data, requests, and responses.
    
18. **Consensus Mechanism**: A system used in DWNs to achieve agreement on a single data value or network state among distributed nodes or processes.
    
19. **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, commonly used in DWNs for automating processes.
    
20. **Cryptography**: The practice of securing communications in DWNs, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
    
21. **Hashing**: A process in DWNs of converting an input into a fixed-size string of text, typically for security or data integrity purposes.
    
22. **Tokenization**: The conversion of rights or assets into a digital token format in a DWN, often for secure transactions.
    
23. **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**: A protocol and network used in DWNs to store and share data in a distributed file system.
    
24. **Encryption**: The process of encoding data in DWNs to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring privacy and security.
    
25. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols for building and integrating application software, crucial in DWNs for interacting with different software components.
    
26. **Distributed Ledger**: A consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions in a DWN.
    
27. **Node**: An individual computer connected to a DWN network that participates in network activities like data storage, processing transactions, or maintaining the network.
    
28. **Scalability**: The ability of a DWN system to handle growing amounts of work or to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
