# Introduction

Welcome back to our HTML for Beginners series! In my previous [article](https://annietah.hashnode.dev/building-your-first-movie-recommendation-website-with-html), we built a movie recommendation website using HTML headings, sections, and paragraph elements. We also looked at how an HTML5 file is structured. Today, we're going to embark on a journey to create a retro-90s-looking website using the list, anchor, and image elements to celebrate a special occasionâ€”your birthday! Get ready to relive the iconic decade by building a web page that will take your guests on a nostalgic trip back in time.

In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a fun-filled 90s-themed website using HTML. So, let's dive in!

## **Prerequisites**

Before we begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your computer:

1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A beginner-friendly code editor that offers a comfortable environment for web development.
    
    * Download it from: [**https://code.visualstudio.com/**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
        
2. Live Server Extension: This handy extension allows you to preview your HTML web page in real time as you make changes.
    
    * Install it from the VS Code Extensions marketplace within VS Code.
        

## Getting Started

###   
Setting the Scene

We'll create the basic structure of our website. Use the following code as a template to get you started:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>90s Retro Birthday Bash</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Add your content here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Spreading the News

  
Let your guests know what's happening! In the body section of your HTML, create a header to display the exciting birthday message:

```html
<header>
    <h1>Welcome to the 90s Retro Birthday Bash!</h1>
</header>
```

### Save the Date  

Make sure your guests mark their calendars with the date of your spectacular 90s party:

```html
<section>
    <h2>Date: July 25th, 2023</h2>
</section>
```

### Packing the Essentials  

Help your guests prepare for the ultimate 90s experience by listing the must-have items they should bring:

```html
<section>
    <h2>What to Bring:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your favorite 90s outfit</li>
        <li>A mixtape of your favorite 90s songs</li>
        <li>Good vibes and dance moves</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```

### Rewinding Memories  

Add a 90s image to set the nostalgic mood:

```html
<section>
    <h2>Memories from the 90s:</h2>
    <img src="image1.jpg" alt="90s image 1">
    <!-- Add more images here if you have them -->
</section>
```

### Let's Groove  

Provide your guests with directions to the coolest 90s venue in town:

```html
<section>
    <h2>Party Location:</h2>
    <p>Come join us at the coolest 90s venue in town: <a href="https://example.com/90s-venue">The 90s Hangout</a></p>
</section>
```

### Closing Notes  

Wrap up your website with some closing notes to build anticipation for the big day:

```html
<footer>
    <p>Don't miss the fun! Let's celebrate like it's the 90s all over again!</p>
</footer>
```

The final code base should look like this:  

```xml
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>90s Retro Birthday Bash</title>
    </head>
     <body>
     <!-- Adding a header to display the birthday message -->
         <header>
             <h1>Welcome to the 90s Retro Birthday Bash!</h1>
         </header>
     <!-- Adding a section to display the date of the birthday -->
         <section>
             <h2>Date: July 25th, 2023</h2>
         </section>
     <!-- Adding a section to list what people should bring -->
         <section>
             <h2>What to Bring:</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li>Your favorite 90s outfit</li>
                 <li>A mixtape of your favorite 90s songs</li>
                 <li>Good vibes and dance moves</li>
             </ul>
         </section>
     <!-- Adding images from the 90s to create a nostalgic atmosphere -->
         <section>
             <h2>Memories from the 90s:</h2>
             <img src="image1.jpg" alt="90s image 1">
         <!-- Add more images here if you have them -->
         </section>
     <!-- Adding an anchor tag to show the location of the party -->
         <section>
             <h2>Party Location:</h2>
             <p>Come join us at the coolest 90s venue in town:
                 <a href="https://example.com/90s-venue">The 90s Hangout</a>
             </p>
         </section>
     <!-- Adding a footer with some closing notes -->
         <footer>
             <p>Don't miss the fun! Let's celebrate like it's the 90s all over again!</p>
         </footer>
     </body>
</html>
```
