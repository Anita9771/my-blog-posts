## Starting 100 days of code

I am a strong believer that *perfection comes from practice* and I believe this to be true for programming. Like most of us, I've had a lot of '*trials and fails*' from interviews and its almost as if it gets harder everytime. This could be because I bank on already acquired knowledge for preparation. 

So, I thought to myself "*Why not develop and learn new concepts?*" and that's exactly what I will be doing. Hence, this article is to hold me accountable and keep me all geared up for what I'll be engaging myself with for the next 100 days. I know it will not be easy, but, Failing is better than not trying at all.

I did not intend this to be a long read, but subsequent ones might be as I'll be documenting my projects as well as a new concept (if any) as sequels of this post.

Excitedely looking forward to writing closing post when I finish with **100daysOfCode**.

PS: Coding challenges like this helps one build projects for portfolios, improve github contribution statistics and learn a thing or two alongside. So, either ways, its a win-win.
